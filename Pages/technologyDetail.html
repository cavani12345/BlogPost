                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Even before the dust could settle, Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg, admitted before congress that his own personal data had been harvested by a third party in one of the world’s most unethical data abuse investigations.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">These new revelations have kept many Facebook users on the edge of their seats. But allow me to point this story to another direction, and even as we recover from reeling, it wouldn’t hurt to ask, do you personally know your Facebook friend?
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">A friend in need is a friend indeed. This English saying has been recorded hundreds of million times in books, audio, video and one on one communication. It describes the original intention of friendships way before Internet technology was developed. Today with the proliferation of social sites and applications, the world has been shrunk to a global village, making it easy to find old contacts as well as create new connections in an instant.</p>
